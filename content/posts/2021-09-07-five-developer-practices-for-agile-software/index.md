Welcome back to another season of talks and events with the Calgary Software Crafters!

We're very excited to be starting off this season with a talk by David Bernstein, who is presenting "Five Developer Practices for Agile Software":

This 60-90 minute keynote for software developers and non-technical team members looks at essential development practices that help keep software from becoming legacy code and why these practices are vital for sustained success with Scrum.

Based on content from the book Beyond Legacy Code: Nine Practices to Extend the Life (and Value) of Your Software, this session focuses on five development practices that are vital for successfully building software. These five practices include automating the build for continuously integrating software as it is written, collaborating with team members through pair programming, practicing agile design skills that enable testability, using test-first development to drive design, and refactoring code to reduce technical debt.

Together, these five practices are proving to be essential for sustained success with Scrum development. But many Scrum teams have not been exposed to the benefits of these practices or how to use them effectively. In this session, we explore these engineering practices and how to use them to reduce risk and build quality in at every level of the development process.

Bio:
David Bernstein’s continuing passion for software design and construction has led him to train more than 10,000 developers since 1990 for clients that have included Microsoft, IBM, Yahoo, Boeing, AT&T, Sprint, Medtronic, SunGard, State Farm, MetLife, and Weyerhaeuser. As a longtime IBM consultant, David has trained software engineers around the globe, giving them the skills to write the next generation of applications and operating system software. Since 2006, David has devoted his consulting practice to providing organizations with training and coaching for software developers and teams transitioning to Agile and Scrum.
