Functional Programming lets us use functions in the same way as any other data type: we can pass them as parameters, return them from functions, include them in structures, combine them... Most mainstream languages now include FP features, so we don't need to use specialized languages. We'll try the King In Check kata (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5e28ae347036fa001a504bbe). The website describes a Javascript kata but we'll feel free to try other languages.

To keep us focused on Functional Programming, we'll try to follow as many of these Functional Calisthenics as we can: (https://blog.ninjaferret.co.uk/2015/06/05/Introducing-Functional-Calisthenics.html) (https://codurance.com/2017/10/12/functional-calisthenics/)
