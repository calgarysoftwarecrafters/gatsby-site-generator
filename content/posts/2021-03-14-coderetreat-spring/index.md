It's time to take a day to experiment, have fun, and learn something new at this Spring's Coderetreat!

Join a group of awesome developers who will be participating in this worldwide event dedicated to practising the fundamentals of software development and design.

This day-long event is composed of 5 rounds of paired/mobbed practise interspersed with fun games and movement breaks to stave off the threat of zoom fatigue. Each session will give you the chance to solve problems using TDD and challenge yourself with some complicated coding constraints. As this is an online collaborative learning event, we will also be exploring and contrasting some effective methods for remote pairing and mobbing.

Never been to a Coderetreat before? Have no fear, we'll walk you through it all.

Coderetreat is an intensive day of practise, and while it is a great way to learn, it can also be tiring, especially when it’s remote. Because of this, we’re allowing you to choose what length of practise is beneficial for you. You only need to come for the first two sessions, from 9-11. After that, you can leave when you want, or skip a session and come back later if you’d like.

Friday's Schedule
5:30-7:30 How to remote pair and set up environments
(https://www.meetup.com/Calgary-Software-Crafters/events/275755262)

This is a remote session with a heavy emphasis on pair programming and mobbing. Before you attend, we highly recommend that you prepare by ensuring you have an environment set up and enabled for remote pairing.

In order to be ready for this session, please:
1. Register for Zoom and download and install the client, or you can use the web client.

We only send the Zoom link out to registered attendees, just before the event. Make sure you have e-mails switched on for this group otherwise you won't receive the link. To check your settings, follow the instructions here: https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002879591-Editing-my-email-settings.

2. Be set up and ready for remote pairing in your favourite language. If you've never done this before, don't worry! We have a Friday session to show you how to do this.

3. In order to get people up and moving, we'll be experimenting with walking retros, where we go outside for part of the retro. If you want to try this out, please be prepared with weather appropriate clothing and a cellphone with a data plan.
