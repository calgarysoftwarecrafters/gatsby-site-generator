Everyone is talking about event-driven architectures and streaming data. But you may not be actually using them successfully. If you haven’t started yet, you must learn to leverage the power of this approach. And even if you’ve already achieved a measure of success, you still want to ensure your business’s viability and long-term flexibility in design that responds well to the inevitable ongoing change. And why stop at event driven when your entire system can be reactive through message-driven architectures, both inside single services and across many collaborating services?

Vaughn Vernon walks you through DDD context mapping with open host service and Published Language and describes how to integrate using reactive implementations that transform streaming to well-designed solutions. Employing the right tools is key.
